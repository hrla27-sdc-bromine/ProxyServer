The goal of the Abibas System Design Capstone is to scale legacy code and optimize query times by comparing a relational and non-relational database. In the process of optimizing data, a team of engineers compared the cost benefit analysis of horizontal and vertical scaling. 

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB
- PostgreSql
- Express
- Node.Js
- Docker
- NginX
- Redis
- EC2
- Amazon Load Balancer
- Artillery
- Jest
- Loader.io
- Webpack
- React

## Features
- Scaled Database by seeding 10,000,000 documents and/or fields
### In Best Performance
- Reduced the query times by 20x to 3ms
- increased api calls to 3000 RPS with less than .03% error
- Scaled server and database horizontally to utilize six servers w/ load balancing
